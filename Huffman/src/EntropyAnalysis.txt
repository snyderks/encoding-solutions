The entropy of the file is approximately 4.3775, with the average path length
taken on decompression being approximately 4.4185 bits per character. While
this is not a perfect compression as it does not equal entropy, it is very
close to entropy and supports the theorem that the average path length is
greater than or equal to the entropy of the data.
